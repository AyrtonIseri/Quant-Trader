scripts to evaluate efficiency of common ML models on crypto currencies


Logic:
The money get split between agents.
Every agent can have more than one model.
models create and manage opened positions. Their inputs are operations.
operations are generated by indicators.

one model can contain multiple positions bets, though it can only have one indicator.

NOTE
Alter the main model/agent functioning.
The current state implies: model ->(data)-> Indicator ->(recommendation)-> model (each day)
It would work in a much better way if all recommendations were made at once and, after that, the agent only calculated the profits/losses
